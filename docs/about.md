# About

## Project History

The project idea was initially proposed by [Samir A. M. Martins](https://github.com/samirmartins) and [Wilson R. L. Junior](https://github.com/wilsonrljr) as an alternative for individuals who want to use the **SysIdentPy** toolbox but are not familiar with Python, such as medical or economics students. It also serves researchers who want to utilize the functionalities quickly and easily, even on their mobile devices.

Subsequently, the concept was passed on to Júlio C. E. Júnior, a student of Samir, who started developing the web app in the first half of 2022.

**SysIdentPyGUI** was created using [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) due to its user-friendly syntax, regular updates, and active community.

## Active Mainteners

The project is maintained by Júlio César Enezio Júnior under the supervision of Samir Angelo Milani Martins and Wilson Rocha Lacerda Junior.

## Project Status

**SysIdentPyGUI** is currently hosted on ***Streamlit Cloud***. A Dockerfile is available in our repository, allowing users to run a local containerized version of the app.

If you encounter a bug or have a suggestion, please open an issue on our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/jceneziojr/sysidentpygui). We will try to respond to you as soon as possible.

## Future

We aim to make **SysIdentPyGUI** as self-maintaining as possible and up-to-date compared to **SysIdentPy**. Some features from **SysIdentPy** are not yet available, such as the Narx Neural Network. However, they will be analyzed and deployed eventually.
