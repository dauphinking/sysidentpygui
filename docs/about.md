# About

## Project History

The project idea was given first by [Samir A. M. Martins](https://github.com/samirmartins) and [Wilson R. L. Junior](https://github.com/wilsonrljr), as an use alternative for people that would like to use **SysIdentPy** toolbox but aren't familiar with Python, such as medical or economy students. As well as researchers that would like to use the functionalities in a rapid manner through their cellphone or such.

The concept was then handed to Samir's student [Júlio C. E. Júnior](https://github.com/jceneziojr), who started the development of the web app in the first half of 2022.

**SysIdentPyGUI** was developed using [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) due to its practical syntax, constant updates and active community.

## Active Mainteners

The project is maintained by Júlio César Enezio Júnior, under supervision of Samir Angelo Milani Martins and Wilson Rocha Lacerda Junior.

## Project Status

**SysIdentPyGUI** is currently hosted on ***Streamlit Cloud***. A DockerFile is available in our repository allowing the user to run a local containerized version of the app.

If you run into a bug or have a suggestion, please open a issue on our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/jceneziojr/sysidentpygui). We will try to answer you as soon as possible.

## Future

We aim to make **SysIdentPyGUI** as self-maintaining as possible and up to date comparing to **SysIdentPy**. Some features from **SysIdentPy** aren't available yet, like the Narx Neural Network. But they will be analyzed and deployed eventually.
